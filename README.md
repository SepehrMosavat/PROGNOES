PROGNOES is a tool for forecasting harvestable solar energy at a specific location and time.
PROGNOES utilizes various models, algorithms, and libraries for retrieving clear sky
solar irradiation and meteorological datasets, and to carry out the calculations
regarding the forecasting of the harvestable solar energy. The results of the
forecasting procedure can be used by tools such as the SOCRAETES emulator to
directly test energy harvesting devices under realistic conditions.

This repository hosts the codebase of PROGNOES, together with examples to for
getting familiar with the various functionalities of the tool.

Please refer to our paper, presented at the ENSsys 2022 workshop, for more information
regarding the design and implementation of PROGNOES.
